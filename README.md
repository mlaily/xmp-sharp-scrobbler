# XMPlay Sharp Scrobbler #

A Last.fm scrobbling plugin for the XMPlay audio player.

This project started just after the debacle of the new Last.fm website (summer of 2015), which, among other things, broke the xmp-scrobbler plugin I was using at the time.
The xmp-scrobbler plugin, still in beta, unmaintained since 2010, its source code almost lost, was using a multiple time obsolete version of the scrobbling api.
Someone at Last.fm somehow thought it would be a good idea to change the behaviour of this old api, and since then, xmp-scrobbler crashes upon start...

After 10 days of unbearable scrobbling withdrawal, hoping it would get fixed, nothing changed, so I started working on my own scrobbler form scratch.

This is the result.
