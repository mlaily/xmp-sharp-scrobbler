We now have a working base for a plugin written in C#.

Things left to do:
	V	read the last version of last.fm docs about scrobbling
	V	get an event when a new track is played (for the now playing feature)
	V	get the track info
	V	get an event when the track has been played long enough to be scrobbled
	V	transmit all the info to the C# code
	V	implement the scrobbling part in C# (json or xml (?) over http)
	V		we can't reuse an existing library since we don't want any dll dependency
	V	implement the config struct with everything required for the plugin to work
	V	GUI for the configuration
	V	implement some caching mechanism
	.	implement a log file
	V	support unicode
	.	document required environment (.Net 4.6...)
	V	add license
	.	release!
