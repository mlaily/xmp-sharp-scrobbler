We now have a working base for a plugin written in C#.

Things left to do:
	. read the last version of last.fm docs about scrobbling
	. get an event when a new track is played (for the now playing feature)
	. get the track info
	. get an event when the track has been played long enough to be scrobbled
	. transmit all the info to the C# code
	. implement the scrobbling part in C# (json or xml (?) over http)
		. we can't reuse an existing library since we don't want any dll dependency
	. implement the config struct with everything required for the plugin to work
	. GUI for the configuration
	. implement some caching mechanism
